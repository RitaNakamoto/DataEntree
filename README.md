# DataEntree
Modern, interactive, and vibrant.
I've been emerged within the crypto world for multiple years now. It's grown my love for modern technology but it has also taught me the importance of remaining ahead of the times. The answers for "what's next" is right in front of you if you're willing to pay attention.

As a creative I'm quick to adapt to technologies a bit rebellious when it come to traditional corporate standards. I naturally gravitate towards the tech industry because it allows room for growth and agile methodologies. I want my work to be a reflection of that.

When it comes to data visualization, I decided to stray away from boring formatting. Tech should be fun, impressionable, and versatile.
